# Change Log

Version history from v0.2.0 to this day.

## v0.4.0 - Move Code Completion

This update adds code completion.

### Completion

Code completion feature currently works only for standard library modules. It includes
import, module methods and built-in functions suggestions based on cursor context.
More detail will be given in docs section which will be created and improved through
patches in 0.4 version of Move IDE.

This feature can be turned off in extension settings.
